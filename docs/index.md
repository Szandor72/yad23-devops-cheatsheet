# DevOps In Well Architected

## Trusted, Easy, and Adaptable

**Delivery** and **Governance** are cross cutting concern in every Salesforce CRM project.

As Architects we strive to deliver trusted, easy, and adaptable solutions - but would you call **changesets** one of them? For years, they - together with **four sandboxes** - have been our central answer to basically all **deployment** questions. Are they still today?

Options are manifold: there are plenty of **vendors** as well as tools to choose from for help with deployments. We do have **DX** and **source tracking**. Static 'Code' Analysis helps to detect quality issues in Code as well as Metadata. Great news for front-end coders on a Mac who know git and node and bash but we also have **App and Flow Builders**, Apex Devs, Admins, and Analysts working towards production on windows machines.

Then there is a **system landscape** to think of, **test data** to provide that **complies with local laws**, and the question of **End To End Testing** needs answering, too. If you feel you need some guidance, I feel the same. Letâ€™s think about a DevOps Cheat Sheet together and challenge ourselves to fit trusted, easy, and adaptable approaches for Salesforce DevOps on a few sheets of paper.

## Goals

1. Define scope of content

    - What knowledge and experience do we have available on site?

2. Define:

    - [ ] What should be covered on a page?
        - document results
    - [ ] How should each page look like?
        - document results
    - [ ] Timeline

3. Create a template page ( = Tutorial )
4. Form Groups
5. Make it so

## Timeline

- [ ] _Write down timeline here so everyone can have a look_

## Need icons, diagrams, fanciness?
